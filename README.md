# AutofluorescenceRemoval
This repository is for referring autofluorescence removal pipelines

Multiplex immunohistochemistry (mIHC) technologies enable the detection of multiple markers on a single tissue section, providing valuable quantitative data for understanding disease heterogeneity and molecular profiling. Various mIHC techniques, including chromogenic mIHC, TSA-based fluorescence mIHC, metal-based mIHC, cyclic mIHC/IF, and DNA barcoding-based mIHC, have been developed, each with its own advantages and limitations.To address this issue, we investigated an enhanced open-source method using digital processing to eliminate AF. By providing a robust and automated solution for AF elimination, this method enhances the precision of mIHC analysis and facilitates large-scale studies, ultimately contributing to a deeper understanding of disease mechanisms and the development of targeted therapies.
## Step 1 Identification of target proteins and AF

## Step 2 Remove the small objects (noise)

## Step 3 Eliminated AF objects
